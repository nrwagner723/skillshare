# skillshare
i used skillshare as my first introduction to code. i learned a little html/css/and js there. these are all the projects i did using skillshare.

i was following along the skillshare instructors while writing this code, i didn't really do any of this on my own. all of these are my first ever projects and they all took me
about a month to complete them all (in total). i started using skillshare in july of 2021 (approximately).
